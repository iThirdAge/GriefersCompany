Brutal version of [GriefersCoModPack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/GriefersCompany/GriefersCoModPack/). 
The purpose is to make moving around and trying other mod packs easier with our config.

Contains some extra fun, more moons, more interiors, new enemies, and changes to existing enemies

Recommended to use [LethalQuantities](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BananaPuncher714/LethalQuantities/) webUI to manage the moons and other configurations

The [FFXIV Moons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BoboBoba/Bobos_XIV_Moons/) uses a view extension that increases draw distance. 
* If you don't have a strong PC to host, it is recommended to disable the [view extension](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sfDesat/ViewExtension/) mod or uninstall this FFXIV moons pack entirely
